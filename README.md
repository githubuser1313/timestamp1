## FreeCodeCamp Timestamp Microservice
By MI MUKIT

This repository is for the freecodecamp api project called "Timestamp Microservice". More details: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice

### User Stories

1. User can pass a string as a parameter, and this app will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
